### Mon 10, August 2020 *[Is Ruby on Rails scalable?]*
Dear dairy, today I learned a lot, we started to create a new RoR project, so I started to read about how to do our app scalable, so first of all some devs say that RoR is not an scalable framework, but I learned that actually frameworks does not have to be scalable but architecture of the project has to be. It depends of your project is how you must to implement your architecture, in order to make it scalable. Today I learn you can use RoR to your project even if is an startup or a big app like Shopify.
